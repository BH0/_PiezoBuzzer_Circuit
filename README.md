# PiezoBuzzer_Circuit (Arduino) 

A prototype in which a Piezo-buzzer plays a minimalistic melody whilst multiple LEDs light up (independently) depending on the pitch of the tone (produced by the Piezo-buzzer).

Note: this version of the code requires some cleanup but I chose to leave the "zombie code" in for reference purposes, in case I decide to make future changes. And the references to other folders, files relevant to the topic can be ignored (this isn't a production application) - and don't attempt making any commits to this repository, I will probably revise the code & upload another (more cleaner) file / repository which others may contribute too. The project was for learning purposes, and is now a trophy more than anything else. 

Special thanks to Discord member (*unnamed-for-now*) for providing the diagram of the circuit.
