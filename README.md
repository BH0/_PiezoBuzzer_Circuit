# _PiezoBuzzer_Circuit

A prototype in which a Piezo-buzzer plays a minimalistic melody whilst multiple LEDs light up (independently) depending on the pitch of the tone (produced by the Piezo-buzzer).

Note: this version of the code requires some cleanup but I chose to leave the "zombie code" in for reference purposes, in case I decide to make future changes.
